Blender PKG Add-On
Version 1.0
September 20th 2020

Created by Dummiesman

1.Requirements
  The addon was created in Blender 2.83, and may not work in previous verions.
  The addon was tested and appears to work in 2.9+ as well

2.Installation
  - Open the Blender preferences menu, found under Edit->Preferences.

  - Go to the add-ons tab.

  - Click the install button located on the top right corner.

  - Select the downloaded addon ZIP
  
  - Enable it, and enter your game data path

3.Importing
  Textures
    Textures with the format BMP,TGA,TEX will be imported.

  MTX Files
    MTX files will automatically be imported if found

  Geometry Flags
    Because geometry flags are done via geometry, and not via material. These are NOT imported.

4.Exporting
  Reflections
    To change the "Shininess" of a material, change the "Specular" property.

  Geometry Flags
    Using the Emissive material type will export any geometry with that material as shadeless in game

  Textures
    The exporter will try and find the texture by searching the node tree. If it can't find the texture, or it's otherwise not assigned, the material will export untextured.

  XRefs
    To define an xref, simply name an empty object "xref:xrefname". Where xrefname is the name of the PKG file to xref e.g. "sp_parkmtr_f". It does not matter if Blender adds the .001 and so on.

  Paintjobs (Variants)
    Press the N key to bring up the sidebar. You should see a tab called "Angel Tools"
    
    Here you can create and edit paintjobs (variants). 
    
  MTX Files
    MTX files will be created if the location of an object is not 0,0,0. Objects do not need the :m suffix. Adding the :m suffix will crash the game, because it will be exported with that name into the PKG file.

  Export Type
    Export type (Dashboard, Trailer, Prop) will be automatically determined. And all types of objects such as city props, buildings, etc should work automatically

  Transparency
    Transparency is done using Blenders native system. Make sure your "Blend Mode" property is set to something other than "Opaque" if you want that material to be transparent in-game.

  Vertex Colors
    You can export vertex colors via the checkbox in the export dialog
    
5.FAQ
  Q:I imported my PKG file, I have my textures in the right format, but I don't see them in Blender!?
    A:You have to be in Material render mode, rather than Solid.
